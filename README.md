Materials for CJ702: Advanced Criminal Justice Statistics at The University of Mississippi. 

Data management and manipulation, measurement, analysis, and visualization are integral to the performance of criminal justice research. This course provides students with the opportunity to learn and practice a range of statistical methods for social science and criminal justice research. We will cover ordinary least squares (OLS) models, generalized linear models for categorical and count data, multilevel models for cross-sectional and longitudinal data, nonlinear and nonparametric models, structural equation models, and statistical models for social network analysis, including exponential random graph models and stochastic actor-oriented models.

Example data for this course are a curated and cleaned subset of the *National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS): MSA Public-Use Data, 2000-2015*.
